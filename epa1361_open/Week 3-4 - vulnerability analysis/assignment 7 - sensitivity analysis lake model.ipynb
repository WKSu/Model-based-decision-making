    "In the previous week you used the lake problem as a means of getting aquinted with the workbench. In this assignment we will continue with the lake problem, focussing explicitly on using it for open exploration. You can use the second part of [this tutoria]https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indepth_tutorial/open-exploration.html) for help.\n",

    "**It is paramount that you are using the lake problem with 100 decision variables, rather than the one found on the website with the seperate anthropogenic release decision**\n",

    "## Apply sensitivity analysis\n",
    "There is substantial support in the ema_workbench for global sensitivity. For this, the workbench relies on [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and feature scoring which is a machine learning alternative for global sensitivity analysis. Generate 10 random release policies. Generate 1000 experiments, and analyse the results using extra trees feature scoring for all outcomes of interest. What can you conclude from these results?\n",
