    "* Sensitivity analysis often focuses on the final values of an outcome at the end of the simulation. However, we can also look at metrics that give us additional information about the behavior of the model over time. Using the statsmodel library and an appropriate sampling design, fit a linear regression model for each of the following indicators. What can we conclude about the behavior of the model, and about the importance of the different inputs?\n",

    "* Perform an appropriate number of experiments with the Sobol sampling functionality included in the Workbench, then analyze the results with SALib for the same three indicators. How can we interpret the first-order and total indices? Does your chosen sample size give a stable estimation of the indices? You'll need to use the [get_SALib_problem](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/salib_samplers.html) function to convert your Workbench experiments to a problem definition that you can pass to the SALib analysis function. \n",

    "* Use the [Extra-Trees analysis](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/analysis/feature_scoring.html) included in the Workbench to approximate the Sobol total indices, with a suitable sampling design. As a starting point, use an ensemble of 100 trees and a max_features parameter of 0.6, and set the analysis to regression mode. Are the estimated importances stable relative to the sample size and the analysis parameters? How do the results compare to the Sobol indices?"
