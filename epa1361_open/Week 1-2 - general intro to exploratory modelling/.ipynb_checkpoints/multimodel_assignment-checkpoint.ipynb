    "This exercise uses a simple version of the [Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) to show how the EMA Workbench can be used for a\n",
    "multi-model analysis, in addition to typical parametric/structural uncertainties. This will let you test the connectors provided in the Workbench for Excel, NetLogo, and Vensim / PySD; we'll also use the models for the sensitivity analysis exercise in week 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the three model files provided and the Python function below, define model objects for each implementation (Excel, NetLogo, Vensim/PySD, and Python), and test them using a single ensemble. Use 50 experiments sampled from the parameters below (so that each experiment will be executed for the 4 models, for a total of 200), and retrieve outputs for the _TIME_, _predators_, and _prey_ variables.\n",
    "    * excel and vensim are only supported on windows\n",
    "    * vensim requires 32 bit python, and a 7.1!! version of vensim DSS\n",
    "    * Netlogo supoprt depends on [jpype](http://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and if you don't have NetLogo installed, please get it from [NetLogo 6.0](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml) \n",
    "    * for pysd, see [its documentation](http://pysd.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html)\n",
    "    * If possible try to work with all model versions, but even 2 or 3 (pure python and something else should be sufficient).\n",

    "\n",
    "* These model objects can be used with a replication functionality (for instance to test the effect of stochastic uncertainty in a NetLogo model), which repeats a given experiment over multiple replications. You can use a single replication in this exercise as the models are not stochastic. By default, each outcome array will then have a shape of (# experiments, # replications, # time steps). Try adapting the outcome arrays so that they can be used with the _lines_ plotting function of the Workbench, and plot the results grouped by model.\n",
