[Green Rivers](https://sites.google.com/view/green-rivers/) is an environmental organization advocating for a healthy, sustainable future for people, rivers, wildlife, and the economy in The Netherlands. We stand for the biodiversity and nature recovery in the areas surrounding the IJssel river.

This project is part of the EPA1361 Model-based Decision-Making course taught by Drs. Jan Kwakkel and Hans de Bruijn, and Simon Vydra and Alessio Ciullo.
